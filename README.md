**Steps Taken:**

- **Excel** was used for:
  - Removing duplicate entries
  - Spotting and correcting corrupted characters
  - Normalizing inconsistent artist or song names

- **Power Query in Power BI** handled:
  - Deep character cleansing
  - Data type reclassification (e.g., converting text to numeric)
  - Filtering irrelevant or incomplete records
